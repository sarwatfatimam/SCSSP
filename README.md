The algorithm Separable Common Spatio Spectral Pattern (SCSSP) has been developed based on the following research paper:

Aghaei, Amirhossein S., Mohammad Shahin Mahanta, and Konstantinos N. Plataniotis. "Separable Common Spatio-Spectral Patterns for Motor Imagery BCI Systems." IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 63.1 (2016): 15-29.

**How to use it**

1. Add data and all the functions in a folder.
2. Run SCSSP.m 
3. Make sure that you give the correct name and dimension of the data.

**Note:** kindly share your feedback for this code. Thankyou.
