The algorithm Separable Common Spatio Spectral Pattern (SCSSP) has been developed based on the following research paper:

Aghaei, Amirhossein S., Mohammad Shahin Mahanta, and Konstantinos N. Plataniotis. "Separable Common Spatio-Spectral Patterns for Motor Imagery BCI Systems." IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering 63.1 (2016): 15-29.

How To Use It

Add all the functions and the dataset in a folder named SCSSP-Algorithm (or a folder of your own name choice). Now run SCSSP.m and make sure that you give the correct name and format of the dataset in the code. 

If you use this code for the algorithm, kindly share your feedback and performance results. Thankyou.
